# UumuuPlus

A mod that strengthens Uumuu, inspired by a Discord user named Bigal

- [x] Uumuu’s health is increased to 900

- [x] Oomas are summoned even outside of Godhome, though won’t damage Uumuu outside of Godhome either

- [x] Summoned Oomas can randomly fire four of Gorb’s Spears in a cross pattern

- [x] Uumuu will have eight Uomas revolving around it, and killing all of these enemies will make Quirrel slash Uumuu making it vulnerable. In Godhome killing the Uomas will force Uumuu to use the Summon attack to summon Oomas

- [x] Uumuu getting hit by Quirrel or an Ooma will make Uumuu spew several damaging Infection blobs

- [x] Uumuu can fire twelve of Gorb’s spears in the same circular pattern that are followed by electricity

- [x] Uumuu can quickly charge to the player’s location Instead of the Chase attack having lightning follow the player, lightning will form in random locations around the player

- [ ] ~~Uumuu can occasionally fire three explosive Ooma projectiles at the player~~(It's too hard for me)

- [x] Nail bouncing on Uumuu while invulnerable will create an explosion
